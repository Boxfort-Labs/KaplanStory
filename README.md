# [KaplanStory](https://bigcooki3.github.io/KaplanStory/)
A short Overwatch fangame made in Unity, about Jeff Kaplan.

This game was made by myself and my best friend Kevin La, for Dinoflask's Kaplanniversary Giveaway contest. All assets and scripts were made from scratch using Photoshop and C#, with the exception of character concepts and audio (it's a fangame). We placed runner-up!
The bulk of the work was completed in just four days, with this being our first game made in Unity.
Anyone is welcome to view the source code, however many things remain unoptimized and the code is extremely messy, due to the short amount of time we tried to complete this in. Discretion is advised. I'm way more organized than this, I swear.
