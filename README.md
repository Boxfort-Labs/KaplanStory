# [KaplanStory](https://boxfort-labs.github.io/KaplanStory-game/)
A short Overwatch fangame made in Unity, about Jeff Kaplan.

This game was made for Dinoflask's Kaplanniversary Giveaway contest. All assets and scripts were made from scratch using Photoshop and C#, with the exception of character concepts and audio (it's a fangame). We placed runner-up!
The bulk of the work was completed in just four days, with this being our first game made in Unity.

This project was made in Unity version 5.6.2.
